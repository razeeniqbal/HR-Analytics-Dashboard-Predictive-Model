# HR Analytics: Talent Retention & Engagement Predictor

## Project Overview

This HR Analytics project uses machine learning to help organizations:
- Predict which employees are at risk of leaving
- Understand key factors driving attrition
- Analyze department-level trends and metrics
- Generate actionable recommendations for improving retention

## Dataset

Link Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
The project uses the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset, which contains:
- Employee demographic information
- Job-related features
- Satisfaction metrics
- Compensation data
- Work history

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize key HR metrics and identify patterns
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models to predict attrition risk
- **Interactive Dashboard**: User-friendly interface to explore data and get predictions
- **Actionable Insights**: Practical recommendations for employee retention

## Technical Components

- **Data Preprocessing**: Feature engineering, scaling, and encoding
- **Model Training**: Multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics and comparisons
- **Dashboard**: Interactive Streamlit application for visualization and predictions

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning model development and evaluation
- Data visualization and dashboard creation
- HR analytics domain knowledge
- Python programming (pandas, scikit-learn, streamlit, etc.)

## Key Discoveries

- Overtime significantly increases quit rates 
- Work-life balance matters more than salary for many employees
- Career growth opportunities reduce turnover 
- Different departments have unique retention challenges 

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced ML models (XGBoost, Deep Learning)
- Add time-series analysis for temporal patterns
- Develop an API for model deployment
- Integrate with HR systems for real-time predictions
